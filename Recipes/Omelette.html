        This is how to make a perfect, and utterly delicious, Spanish torilla.
      </p>
      <p>Ingredients</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Six eggs</li>
        <li>Two potatoes, peeled, cut in half, and sliced horizontally</li>
        <li>One large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>One litre of olive oil</li>
    <p>Steps</p>
  </ul>
      <ol>
      <li>
        In a large stockpot over medium high heat, add 3/4 litres of olive oil. When it is hot but not smoking, add the potatoes and onions. Lower heat to medium. Cook, poaching the potatoes and onions until the potatoes are fork tender, about 10 minutes.
       </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large bowl, crack your eggs and beat. Add salt. At this time, get all the things you are going to need for the tortilla. A large plate, two frying pans, one medium, one smaller (optional). IMPORTANT NOTE:  THEY MUST BE NON-STICK FRYING PANS. If not, your tortilla will stick and the whole process is ruined.
      </li>
       <li>
        When your potatoes and onions are done, strain them, reserving two tbsp of oil. Let them cool for at least 10 minutes. When your potatoes are cool enough to touch, then mix them in with your scrambled eggs.
      </li>
       <li>
        In a medium frying pan, add one tbsp of your reserved oil. Heat over medium heat until almost smoking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simultaneously, as you are stirring the centre, with your wooden spoon, drag it along the edges to make sure that it is drying up.
      </li>
      <li>
        This enables you to make sure that the tortilla is not sticking on the edges, so it will flip loosely onto your large plate. Keep doing these movements until you see little runniness in the middle, and it seems like it is drying up.
      </li>
       <li>
        When you feel that there won’t be enough egg mix lost when you do “The Flip”, then place your large plate (it must be larger than the circumference of your frying pan) on top of the pan,
      </li>
       <li>And with a flick of your wrist, flip the tortilla onto the plate, and then slide back into the frying pan.</li>
       <li>
        At this point, you can choose if you want to place it into a smaller frying pan. I learned this tip from a proper Spanish, who said always move your tortilla into a smaller frying pan to get that nice rounded shape.
       </li>
       <li>If you do switch to a smaller frying pan, then add the remaining one tbsp of olive oil, and heat over a low flame. Either way, if you do or you don’t, you have to start to tuck in the edges of the tortilla, to give it a nice round shape on the edges. And, now the key is if you want it a bit runny, or “JUICY” as they would say here, you either cook it for two more minutes, or seven more minutes. Since I like mine in between, I cook it for five more minutes.</li>
      <li>Slide it back on a clean plate, let rest for at least five minutes, and serve warm with nice crusty tomato bread.</li>
    </ol>
   </ul>
